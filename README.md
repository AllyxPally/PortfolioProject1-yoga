I tested that this page works in different browsers: Firefox, Chrome. 

I have confirmed that the form works, it requires entries in every field and will only accept an email in the email field and the submit button works. 

Bugs 

I noticed that the cover image in my project didn't show up when i deployed it to GitHub Pages.  This was because i had used a absolute filepath in the url. 
Removing the / and adding ../ solved the problem
